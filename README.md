# Tarkov Keybinds for Logitech MX Creative Console

This plugin maps Tarkov's keybinds to the MX Creative Console so you can trigger them with a single button press. 

It exists because Tarkov parses the keypresses in a way that the usual keyboard binds on most decks wont work.

## What's included

The plugin covers most of Tarkov's controls:

- **Movement** — Leaning, smooth leaning, sidesteps, crouch, prone, blind fire positions
- **Weapons** — Reload, fire mode, check ammo/chamber, detach mag, inspect, fold stock
- **Tactical gear** — Flashlight/laser toggles, helmet lights, NVGs, face shields
- **Quick slots** — Weapon slots 1-3 plus quick slots 4-9
- **Utility** — Inventory, compass, voice commands, discard, drop backpack

## Setup

1. Install the plugin through Logi Options+ or drop it in your Loupedeck plugins folder
2. Add the actions you want to your console layout
3. Make sure Tarkov is using default keybinds (or adjust accordingly)

The plugin sends the actual key combinations to Windows, so Tarkov sees them as regular keyboard input. No game files are modified.

## Note on screenshots

Tarkov's screenshot key (PrtScn) doesn't work reliably when sent programmatically. If you want the screenshot button to work, rebind it in Tarkov's settings to just "Print" instead of "PrtScn".
